# SCT_TASK-1-
# Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption Program

##  Task Overview

**Task 01 – SkillCraft Technology Internship**

Create a program that can **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**. The program allows users to:

- Input a message
- Provide a shift value
- Perform encryption or decryption based on user choice

---

##  Problem Statement

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. In this method:

- Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- For example, with a shift of 3:  
  - A → D  
  - B → E  
  - Z → C (wraps around)

---

##  Implementation

This notebook includes:

- A function to **encrypt** any given text with a user-defined shift.
- A function to **decrypt** text by reversing the shift.
- Clean user input prompts to select operation, enter messages, and specify shift value.
